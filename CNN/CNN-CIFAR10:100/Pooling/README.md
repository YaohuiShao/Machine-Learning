# CNN-CIFAR10/100-Pooling
These projects aim to investigate the effect of pooling layer in Convolutional Neural Network designed for training on the datasets CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. 
"x" means max Pooling.
"m" means mean Pooling.
"frac" means fractional Pooling.
"22" means pooling_ratio is 1,2,2,1.
"32" means pooling_ratio is 1,math.sqrt(3), math.sqrt(3), 1.
